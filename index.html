                                                <p>Richard Hamp—or “Rick” as they call him in the biz—is an award-winning novelist, property manager, and aspiring programmer…the aforementioned "award" being a participation ribbon for the 2nd grade sack race. He still keeps the accolade on his wall in an effort to impress people--frequently making up outlandish lies about how he got it. Still, he’s managed to publish some silly stories that his mom says are “really special”, just like him. He’s also one of the organizers of one of the local critique groups. Which is odd considering his penchant for dodging any kind of responsibility.
                    
                                                        After having too many majors than should strictly be allowed by law in undergrad, he moved on to graduate work in the academic study of religion. He likes to say his studies were academic only and he’s not out to convert anyone to anything, but that simply isn’t true. Ever since discovering The Great British Baking Show he has been relentless in trying to get everyone to convert to weighing their ingredients when baking instead of measuring with cups and spoons like savages.
                                                        
                                                        Rick currently works as a property manager at a large HOA. His days are filled with telling vendors how they are terrible people, ensuring multi-million dollar projects are plodding along at the glacial pace expected, being a taskmaster for his assigned minions, babysitting adults, and ensuring the incoming class of freshmen at CU Boulder don’t burn anything too important to the ground.
                                                        
                                                        Rick’s single regret is that he has only one life to give for House Stark.
